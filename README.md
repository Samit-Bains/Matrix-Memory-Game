# Matrix-Memory-Game

This game is meant to replicate the game 'Memory Matrix' by Lumiosity. It was also part of a bigger project that had a site with multiple games.
PHP was used for the backend and managing user data while JavaScript was used to build the actual game.
An example of the original game can be seen from the link below:
